### 🚀 Next-generation AI system for detecting fake text, AI-generated images, manipulation, and misinformation

**AMKID** is an advanced content-trust system that evaluates whether text or images can be trusted.  
It combines AI analysis, manipulation detection, factual reasoning, image forensics, and a mathematically robust Trust Score.

AMKID determines:

- ✍️ How likely the text was generated by AI  
- 🎭 Whether the text contains manipulation, persuasion, or emotional pressure  
- 🔬 How factual and truthful each claim is  
- 🖼️ How likely the image is AI-generated or digitally altered  
- 🧯 Whether the image contains visual anomalies  
- 📊 A unified Trust Score (0–100)  

AMKID is not just a GPT detector —  
it is a full-spectrum trust analysis framework.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔎 Text Analysis

AMKID extracts:

- `ai_likeliness` — probability that the text is AI-generated  
- `manipulation_score` — how manipulative the text is  
- `emotion_intensity` — emotional intensity  
- `dangerous_phrases` — harmful or risky expressions  
- `claims_evaluation` — array of statements with truth rating:  
  - `text` — the statement itself  
  - `true_likeliness` — plausibility (0–1)  
  - `comment` — explanation  
- `summary` — brief summary of the text  
- `trust_score` — final trust score (0–100)  

Used:

- OpenAI GPT-4.1-mini (via API)  
- External AI text detector (ZeroGPT)  
- Proprietary algorithm for aggregating features into a single Trust Score  
- Hugging Face model for image analysis

### 🖼️ Image Analysis

For an image, AMKID determines:

- `ai_likeliness` — probability that the image is AI-generated (0–1)  
- `manipulation_risk` — risk of editing / forgery (0–1)  
- `realism` — visual realism (0–1)  
- `anomalies` — list of visual anomalies (strange anatomy, shadows, text, distortions)  
- `summary` — brief conclusion about the image  
- `trust_score` — final trust level for the image (0–100)  

Used:

- Hugging Face Vision model for image analysis  
- If necessary, external detectors with safe fallback

## 🧮 Intelligent Trust Score

Instead of a simple "percentage addition," AMKID uses:

> **Weighted geometric mean** of multiple metrics

For text, the following axes are taken into account:

- **Factual** — factual truthfulness of claims (`true_likeliness`)  
- **Authenticity** — similarity to human text (based on `ai_likeliness`)  
- **Integrity** — absence of manipulation (`manipulation_score`)  
- **Tone** — emotional adequacy (`emotion_intensity`)  
- **Safety** — absence of dangerous wording (`dangerous_phrases`)  

For images:

- **Authenticity** — non-AI origin  
- **Integrity** — risk of forgery (`manipulation_risk`)  
- **Realism** — visual realism (`realism`)  
- **Anomalies** — number and significance of visual anomalies  

A weak metric (e.g., high manipulation) **greatly reduces the Trust Score**,  
resulting in behavior closer to real-world risk models (banking, insurance).

## 🧠 Architecture

**Frontend:**

- Vite + React + TypeScript  
- Integrated authorization  
- Language switching  
- History display  
- UI for text input and image upload  
- Display of Trust Score and all metrics in a convenient format  

**Backend:**

- Endpoints:  
  - `POST /analyze-text` — analyzes text  
  - `POST /analyze-image` — analyzes an image
  - `POST /auth/register` - creates user, hashes password, returns JWT token
  - `POST /auth/login` -  verifies credentials, returns JWT token
- Service layer:  
  - `analyze_text(content: str) -> TextAnalyzeResponse`  
  - `analyze_image(image_bytes: bytes) -> ImageAnalyzeResponse`
  - `Submission Service Layer (submission_service.py)`
  - `Authentication Service/Utility Layers`
  - `TrustScoreAssembler Class (services/metrics_assembler.py)`  
- AI integrations:  
  - OpenAI Chat Completions (GPT-4.1-mini)  
  - Hugging Face Vision (for images)  
  - ZeroGPT API (for AI text detection)  

**Math Core:**

- Weighted geometric mean  
- Exponential penalties for dangerous phrases and anomalies  
- Normalization in the ranges [0,1] and [0,100]

# 💬 Why this project is worth buying

- This isn't just "another GPT detector" — it's an integrated content trust system.  
- Works with both text and images.  
- Explains decisions: shows **why** we trust or distrust.  
- Built on modern models (GPT-4.1 / Vision) plus external detectors.  
- The Trust Score algorithm is transparent and can be customized for business cases.
